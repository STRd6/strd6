== DungeonFarmer

v0.0 Release for RubyWeekend #2
 
This game is still +very+ crude.

Creatures:
  -Farmer: He's the guy you give directions to. Keep him fed so he won't die.
  -Squirrel (Chipmunk): This guy likes to run off with seeds and interfere!
  -Goblin: Goblins live in the ground and will accost you and your plants.
  -Dog: The dog will one day defend you, not today though.
  -Raccoon: The raccoon peacefully wanders.

Actions: 
  -Plant (looks like a little bag)
    The farmer will plant seeds in the selected area.
  -Dig (looks like a pick and rocks)
    The farmer will dig in the selected area. Digging makes impassable squares 
  passable as well as uncovers gems and goblins.
  -Get (looks like hand with fruit)
    The farmer will get any items in the area designated.
  
Controls:
  Right-Click: Change action selection
  Left-Click (+ drag): Designate current action over an area

Items:
  Seeds: These grow into plants when planted.
  Plants: These create seeds and fruit.
  Fruit: Eat this to survive.
  Gold & Gems: Collect these for points.

Winning:
  Dig up gems for points. Plant crops so as not to die.

Losing:
  Game over if you run out of food.
